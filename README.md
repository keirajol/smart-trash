## Introduction

Smart Trash is an IoT based reminder system that helps households remember waste collection days.
The system retrieves waste collection data from an online API and translates this information into a physical reminder inside the home.

When a waste collection day is approaching, the device lights up in a specific color that represents the type of waste. The reminder remains active until the user presses a button to confirm that the waste has been taken outside.
